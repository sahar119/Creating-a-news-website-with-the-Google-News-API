### <h3 align="left">How does it work</h3>
---
This website is built with Python and Streamlit and uses a Google News API key to fetch news. Also on the left side of the page was a constant warning, and after a defined interval, the user got a warning alarm at the bottom of the page. In the warning alarm, a hyperlink was provided that redirected to a page on a website that describes the side effects of doomscrolling on mental health. Also, there was a closed window to close the warning message.
